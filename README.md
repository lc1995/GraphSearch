This is a basic realization about graph and graph search in Unity.
It contains four algorithm in graph search:
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra
- AStar(Using Manhattan distance as the heuristic)

It also includes two basic demo scene to test the algorithm. You can change the code in *TestGraph.cs* and *Map.cs* to change the testing.
For the reference you can check the book <Programming Game AI by Example> Chapter 5 by Mat Buckland.
